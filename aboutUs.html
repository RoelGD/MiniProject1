        <span class="main_article1">As fellow graduate students at MIT in 2004, Brian and Dharmesh noticed a shift in the way people shop and buy. Consumers were no longer tolerating interruptive bids for their attention — in fact, they'd gotten really, really good at ignoring them.
          From this shift, a company was born: HubSpot. It was founded on "inbound", the notion that people don't want to be interrupted by marketers or harassed by salespeople — they want to be helped.
          Today, the inbound movement continues to empower businesses around the world to stop interrupting, start helping, and return their focus to the customer.</span>
